Heatmap
=======

Heatmap provides a simple, single helper method that generates a cloud-style heatmap based on a provided histogram.

Installation
============

Install the plugin as usual:

  script/plugin install bantik-heatmap
  
Then add this line to your application controller:

  helper_method :heatmap

That's it!

Example
=======

To generate a heatmap, simply call the method from the view, passing in a preprepared histogram. The size and color of each key is calculated based on the associated value from the histogram.

In the controller:

  def index
    @histogram ||= {
      'Foo' => 13,
      'Bar' => 15,
      'Trouble' => 5,
      'Braids' => 1,
      'Something' => 9,
      'Else' => 13,
      'Many' => 20,
      'Zombies' => 7,
      'nothing' => 0
    }
  end

In your view:

  <%= heatmap(@histogram) -%>
